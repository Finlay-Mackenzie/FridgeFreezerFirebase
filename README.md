# FridgeFreezerFirebase
shrunk clone of the main app for external invigilator(s)

in order for firebase to work properly, the local machine the repo was cloned to must have node package manager installed. 
the firebase SDK tooling must then be installed. Webpack is an optional install but not nessasary for this particular application to simplify it down.
